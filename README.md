# Project Information and Future Plans
## Info
This bot was created through the help of Youtube and little modification from me. The bot is a personal assistant created using python and other python libraries such as the following:
- `ctypes`
- `speech-recongnition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `webbrowser`
- `datetime`

Its been a while since i've worked on this project but I believe `pyttsx3` didnt work on the latest pyton(at that time(roughly 4 or 5 years ago)) so I had to downgrade to Python 3.6, but im sure it works now with the latest version.
