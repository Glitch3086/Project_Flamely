# Project Information and Future Plans
## Info
This bot was created through the help of Youtube and little modification from me. The bots name is Flamely and he is a personal assistant created using python and other python libraries such as the following:
- `ctypes`
- `speech-recongnition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `webbrowser`
- `datetime`

Its been a while since i've worked on this project but I believe `pyttsx3` didnt work on the latest pyton(at that time(roughly 4 or 5 years ago)) so I had to downgrade to Python 3.6, but im sure it works now with the latest version.
## Current Capabilities 
It can do basic response such as timely greetings and acknowledgments. It can open file explorer and even search the web. Flamely can open social media as a part of searching the web, all you have to do is tell it! He is also capable of putting your computer to sleep when you command it.

## Future Plans
- Faster responce time
- Complex dialog
- More control of the computer
